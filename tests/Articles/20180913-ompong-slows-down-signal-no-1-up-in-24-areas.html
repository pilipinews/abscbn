Fisherfolk and those with small seacrafts are advised not to venture out as storm surges may reach up to 5 to 6 meters in the seas near Isabela and Cagayan, weather forecasters said.

"Ang maximum rainfall ay maaaring maranasan sa Cagayan at Isabela simula sa Biyernes at sa Sabado, ang maximum rainfall ay mararanasan sa Baguio," forecasters said.

(The maximum rainfall may be experienced in Cagayan and Isabela on Friday while Baguio will experience maximum rainfall on Saturday.)

Ompong is expected to exit the Philippine area of responsibility by Sunday morning.
