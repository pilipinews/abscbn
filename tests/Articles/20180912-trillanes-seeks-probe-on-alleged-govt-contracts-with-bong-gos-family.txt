MANILA - Senator Antonio Trillanes IV on Wednesday filed a resolution seeking an inquiry into a report that a company allegedly owned by relatives of President Rodrigo Duterte's long-time aide bagged construction projects in Davao City.

Trillanes said the investigation sought to determine possible "conflict of interest." The deals were awarded to CLTG Builders, reportedly owned by the father and stepbrother of Special Assistant to the President Christopher Lawrence "Bong" Go, according to the Philippine Institute for Investigative Journalism.

Go said last Monday he was ready to face any investigation (https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/09/10/18/bong-go-ready-to-face-probe-over-familys-contracts-with-dpwh). He also denied brokering any construction deals for his family.

"Kahit bukas agad pwede akong sumalang sa Senado, para naman mabisita ko siya kung saan sya nagtatago," he said, referring to Trillanes.

(Even tomorrow, I can go the Senate, so that I can visit him where he is hiding.)

Trillanes has been holed up at the Senate for nearly 2 weeks after Duterte withdrew the former Navy lieutenant's amnesty over 2 failed military uprisings.
