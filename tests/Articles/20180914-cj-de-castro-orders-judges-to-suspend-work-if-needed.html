CJ DE CASTRO ORDERS JUDGES TO SUSPEND WORK IF NEEDED

MANILA - Supreme Court Chief Justice Teresita Leonardo-de Castro on Friday instructed executive judges to suspend work in their respective courts if they think that their area will be affected by Typhoon Ompong.

As of 5 a.m., the suspension of work in courts depends on the discretion of executive judges "due to their personal knowledge of the circumstances of their locality," the Supreme Court said in a statement.

"There's no work suspension for National Criminal Justice Reference (NCJR) courts except courts located in the Manila City Hall," the statement read.

Storm signal number 3 has been raised over Isabela while 39 other provinces are under signals 1 and 2 as Typhoon Ompong looms close to the northern part of Luzon, state weather bureau PAGASA said in its 5 a.m. bulletin.

The typhoon is expected to make landfall in Cagayan province Saturday morning, and leave the Philippine Area of Responsibility by Sunday morning.
