MANILA - The Liberal Party is eyeing 2 former chief justices, artists, lawyers and former Cabinet men to fill up its slate for the 2019 senatorial election, the party president said Wednesday.

Sen. Francis Pangilinan said the Liberal Party is inclined to not fill up a 12-person slate and instead have a "lean and mean ticket" in coalition with different groups, including Bayan, Aksyon, Magdalo, and Tindig Pilipinas.

Apart from Sen. Bam Aquino who is up for re-election, LP is also talking to actors Dingdong Dantes and Agot Isidro, and singers Jim Paredes and Leah Navarro.

Former Presidential Spokesperson Edwin Lacierda, Communications Official Manolo Quezon and Social Welfare Secretary Dinky Soliman were also in the initial list shared by Pangilinan to ANC's Headstart.

Magdalo Rep. Gary Alejano and former Quezon Rep. Erin Ta√±ada may also be fielded, said Pangilinan.

Free Legal Assistance Group Chairman Manuel "Chel" Diokno, Vice President Leni Robredo's legal counsel Barry Gutierrez, and former Solicitor General Florin Hilbay were also in the initial list.

Pangilinan said he is also currently in talks with former Interior Secretary Mar Roxas "to find out what his plans are."

He is also meeting with ousted Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno, said Pangilinan.

Former Chief Justice Hilario Davide said he "is not inclined to run," but Pangilinan said he was telling the 82-year-old ex-top magistrate, "habang may buhay, may pag-asa."
