QUEZON - A passenger boat carrying 23 passengers and crew sank in the waters off Polillo Strait in Quezon province Tuesday afternoon.

Initial investigation of the Philippine Coast Guard showed the water pump of MB Recto malfunctioned, causing the wooden outrigger ferry to sink.

All passengers and crew of MB Recto were rescued by a motorized banca that was tailing behind them.

A witness who requested not to be named told ABS-CBN News that MB Recto left Dinahican Port at 2:30 p.m. en route to the municipality of Panukulan in Polillo Island.

While they were crossing Polillo Strait, the witness said they heard the crew of MB Recto asking for help after the ferry suffered engine trouble.

The incident, caught on video, showed how MB Recto was swamped by water within few minutes.

The passengers and crew clung into the debris amid choppy waters.

Life vests were tossed to them by the other passengers and crew from the separate motorized banca. They were plucked from the water until they got close to the rescuers.

The victims, the witness said, safely arrived in Panukulan past 6 p.m.
